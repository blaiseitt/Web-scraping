# Web scraper for radio stations

The purpose of this project is creating simple web scraper that ftch data from radio stations web pages about songs they played.
I do it only for learning and self-improvment it's no commercial :D
I also would like to make some frontend with angular or react and some python microservice for categorization of songs and giving them tags so I can understand microservice architecture better. 

Technologies used so far: Selenium, Jsoup, SpringBoot
